# Angular Tour Of Heroes

This repository follows Angular JavaScript application framework's
["Tour of Heroes" tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes). It
represents my second attempt to learn Angular. My first effort is archived
and available under the `angular-11` branch because Angular was at version 11
at the time. My second attempt will use Angular 15.

After completing the Angular 15 updated version of "Tour of Heroes" tutorial,
I changed its visual appearance with
["Angular Material"](https://material.angular.io) components
