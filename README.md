# Angular Tour Of Heroes Tutorial Application

This repository contains:
* Work as I followed the Angular "Tour of Heroes"
[application tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial)
* Experimenting with
[angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages)
plugin to deploy this app to
[GitHub Pages](https://roger-random.github.io/angular-tour-of-heroes/)
* Months later, returning to learn how to upgrade angular (ng upgrade) and
then making it all work inside a
[Visual Studio Code Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
