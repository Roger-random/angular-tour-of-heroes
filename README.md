# Angular Tour Of Heroes

This repository follows Angular JavaScript application framework's 
["Tour of Heroes" tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes). It
represents my second attempt to learn Angular. My first effort is archived
and available under the `angular-11` branch because Angular was at version 11
at the time. My second attempt will use Angular 15.

Information below is the README.md generated by Angular's "ng new" tool
to create application boilerplate:

---

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
